# Homework_01-Code_Refactor

## Project Description

The aim of this project was to take an existing website for a company and refactor its code to meet accessibility standards. These standards ensure that a website can be viewed and experienced properly to the widest possible audience of site visitors. To achieve this, I included more descriptive semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, main, article, aside, and footer to replace generic <div> sections. I also added alt attributes to images so that screen reader applications would not be thrown off by misattributed image tags. The CSS was full of redundant classes, so I consolidated those as much as possible while retaining the style and layout of the original webpage. The Title of the website was also left out, so I named it after the company: Horiseon Social Solution Services. Finally I added comments to delineate the basic layout of the page in the HTML and CSS.

Source Code- Include Semantic Html elements:be more descriptive than just "div"

HTML Elements- Follows logical structure

IMG elements must have accessible alt attributes
